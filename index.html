            <p>Light composite materials are typically used in unmanned aircraft to save weight and improve manoeuvrability. Military drones can fly at exceptionally high altitudes thanks to the strength of the composite material.An unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts, the drone itself and the control system.</p>

            <p>VR has the potential to completely transform a number of facets of our life, including social connections, work, and education. Users will be able to manipulate their senses to create realistic, immersive experiences. VR will become a game-changing technological trend as it gets lighter and more inexpensive. AI, customised virtual worlds, and lightning-fast networking will all complement this. VR is already revolutionising education; Facebook, HTC, and the European Commission are just a few of the companies that are providing remote learning opportunities. These teaching and learning techniques will be improved by new technology like the Teslasuit.</p>

            <p>The ability of a digital computer or robot to carry out actions associated with intelligent beings, such as reasoning, finding meaning, generalising, and learning from prior experiences, is known as artificial intelligence (AI). Since the 1940s, when the digital computer was developed, computers have been able to be programmed to efficiently carry out complicated tasks. Programmes cannot, however, match human adaptability across broader areas or activities requiring a great deal of common knowledge. Artificial intelligence is used in applications like medical diagnostics, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots because some programmes have reached the performance levels of human specialists and professionals in carrying out particular specified jobs. Intelligence is a composite of many different skills rather than a single characteristic. AI research</p>

            <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driven by 5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology. It's the case that the fifth time is a charm. Yes, 5G is more rapid than 4G. However, 5G offers much more than just (much) faster connectivity over its predecessors. It also offers much more stable and secure connectivity. Additionally, 5G allows data to travel with a much reduced latency—the time between data submission and arrival—between one location and another.
                This is how it operates: The service area of 5G networks is segmented into geographical sub-areas known as cells, just like that of all cellular networks. Every cell is equipped with local antennae that allow radio waves to connect all wireless devices within the cell to the internet and phone network. </p>
