            <p>Light composite materials are typically used in unmanned aircraft to save weight and improve manoeuvrability. Military drones can fly at exceptionally high altitudes thanks to the strength of the composite material.An unmanned aerial vehicle system has two parts, the drone itself and the control system.</p>

            <p>VR has the potential to completely transform a number of facets of our life, including social connections, work, and education. Users will be able to manipulate their senses to create realistic, immersive experiences. VR will become a game-changing technological trend as it gets lighter and more inexpensive. AI, customised virtual worlds, and lightning-fast networking will all complement this. VR is already revolutionising education; Facebook, HTC, and the European Commission are just a few of the companies that are providing remote learning opportunities. These teaching and learning techniques will be improved by new technology like the Teslasuit.</p>

            <p>The ability of a digital computer or robot to carry out actions associated with intelligent beings, such as reasoning, finding meaning, generalising, and learning from prior experiences, is known as artificial intelligence (AI). Since the 1940s, when the digital computer was developed, computers have been able to be programmed to efficiently carry out complicated tasks. Programmes cannot, however, match human adaptability across broader areas or activities requiring a great deal of common knowledge. Artificial intelligence is used in applications like medical diagnostics, computer search engines, voice or handwriting recognition, and chatbots because some programmes have reached the performance levels of human specialists and professionals in carrying out particular specified jobs. Intelligence is a composite of many different skills rather than a single characteristic. AI research</p>

            <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driven by 5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology. It's the case that the fifth time is a charm. Yes, 5G is more rapid than 4G. However, 5G offers much more than just (much) faster connectivity over its predecessors. It also offers much more stable and secure connectivity. Additionally, 5G allows data to travel with a much reduced latency—the time between data submission and arrival—between one location and another.
                This is how it operates: The service area of 5G networks is segmented into geographical sub-areas known as cells, just like that of all cellular networks. Every cell is equipped with local antennae that allow radio waves to connect all wireless devices within the cell to the internet and phone network. </p>

            <h2>New 3D printing method designed by Stanford engineers promises faster printing with multiple materials</h2>

            <time>September 28, 2022</time>
            <p>A 3D printing technique called iCLIP, created by researchers at Stanford, promises to produce prints faster by combining different types of resin into a single object. The new design, which was published in Science Advances, can print high-resolution images five to ten times faster than the fastest method currently in use. This could open the door for researchers to use thicker resins with improved mechanical and electrical properties. The object is pulled from a thin pool of resin by a rising platform in the continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) method; this new method improves upon it. The dead zone is critical to CLIP's speed; however, with iCLIP, researchers have installed syringe pumps to supplement resin at strategic locations atop the rising platform. When the object is finished or integrated into the design, the conduits that carry the resin can be removed. The conduits are printed concurrently with the design. As the printing process progresses, iCLIP offers the possibility to print using several types of resin; all that is needed is a separate syringe for each new resin. With software that optimises the fluid distribution network design for every printed piece, the researchers can potentially expedite the printing process while giving designers fine control over the boundaries between different types of resin. </p>
